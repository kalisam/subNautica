      <h2>PURPOSE</h2>

      <h3>To be Pioneers for the Digital Ocean Ecosystem:</h3>

      <p>S.M.A.R.T Capsules, skyscrapers , Cities , and Islands as catalysts for ‘ Seasteading’ Lifestyle.</p>
      <p>‘Underwater Colonization’ and habitation through the modular design, construction, and implementation of underwater habitats, houses, hotels and sub-biospheres.</p>
      <p>‘Aquanautic Simulation Training Facililities’ and Underwater Spacestations for preparing Astronauts and citizen to live in Space and Future Ocean Inhabitants to acclimate to Sub-Sea environment.</p>
      <p>Transdisciplinary Research and Citizen Partnerships leading to Evolutionary , Innovative and Revolutionary progress.</p>
      <p> Exponential Ocean and Space Technologies to enhance the quality of life for all human and animal species.</p>
      <p>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and Governance creating the foundation for Nation-States on the water.</p>
      <p>The Creatrix blueprint and model of the Simulation, Society and Advanced Civilization 3.0!</p>

      <h2>Phase 1</h2>

      <h3>Our proof-of-concept (or Phase 1) infrastructures:</h3>

      <p>
        Customizable modulars: Inter-connected / interchangeable BIO-DOMEs and HYPER-H20-LOOP underwater NETWORKS creating a ‘slipstream or underwater HIGHWAY that allows for flow of access to from residential to commercial to vocational centers!
      </p>
      <p>
        We strive to provide modular style underwater habitats which can be expanded to whatever the need is. Our design and system is an agnostic approach, allowing the individual or company to use them as their needs see fit.
      </p>



      <h2>Phase 2</h2>

      <h3>Phase 2:(( IOTS) Digital Ocean and Digital Ecosystem</h3>

      <h3>Internet of Things and Sentient Life</h3>

      <p>
        GRID SYSTEM for the of Digital, Sapien and Aquatic synergy of interaction. SMART HABITATS,DEVICES, GEAR/SUITS ROBOTIC AI ASSISTANCE and SUBMERSIBLES for fluid exploration, navigation and symbiotic communication with OCEANSCAPE!
      </p>


      <h2>Phase 3</h2>

      <h3>Advanced Civilization or (Phase3):</h3>

      <h3> M.A.P.P.I.N.G and C.H.A.R.T.I.N.G the next dimension</h3>

      <h2>VISION</h2>

      <p>
        To utilize Biomimicry as the ’CORAL REEF FOUNDATION’ for FOSTERING THE FUTURE…</p>
      <p>
        ALLOWING FOR THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN ORGINS AND THE WONDERS OF UNCHARTED FRONTIERS!</p>
      <p>
        WE DESIRE to RECREATE THE ABUNDANT , INFINITE OPULENT AND BIO-DIVERSE OCEAN ECOSYSTEM</p>
      <p>
        As a template for ALL Processes of EXISTENCE ,CREATION , LIFE-SPAN AND INTELLIGENT DESIGN!!!</p>
      <p>
        TO IMAGINEER NEW, NOVEL AND INNOVATIVE POSSIBILITIES FOR A THRIVING WORLD!!!</p>

      <h2>GOAL</h2>

      <p>
        Our goal is to open the underwater world up to anyone who wants to visit, live, or work. A stay at an underwater habitat should be as simple as visiting any other destination on earth. No need to know how to SCUBA dive or even get wet. No
        need to
        decompress upon leaving. If we are to truly colonize the ocean, we must be able to make the transition from land to the oceans as seamless as possible. We want to bring the underwater world to the masses via private and corporate underwater
        facilities.</p>
